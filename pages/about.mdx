Hello there! I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer, and I enjoy working on projects and learning new technologies.

I graduated from Hack Reactor in June 2023, and have since worked on personal projects.
The main project that I'm proud of is Parenting on the Spectrum, which aims to provide
resources to families with an ASD family member. As a parent to 3 neurodivergent boys (2 of which are ASD),
this website is very near and dear to my heart.
